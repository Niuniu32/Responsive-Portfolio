                <img src="assets/AnkerPhoto.JPG" class="Greye" alt="Top Always Down"> Something instresting about me is that i do racing, thou not very competitive due to the fact it does cost
                a lot of money to run a car let alone attending. I do own an S2000, which i call her "Greye(小灰in Chinese)"
                i recently damaged her on a track session and i feel really bad about it, luckly it was just cosmetic.

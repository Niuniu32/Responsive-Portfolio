         <!-- So i had it working before, it algined just like in the photo, however when i was trying to 
         simplify things everything just fall apart and i can't figure out why.
         So the time is tickiing and there is no late submission, so that all i got
         I was going to align my friend taking photo with the rain with text at the bottom.
         And followed by the firework pics right below. with text said fw1 and fw2.
         Sorry that i didn't finish as expected :(
         I work really late just to solv what went wrong, like all night up. -->
